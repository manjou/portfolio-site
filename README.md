<h1>Portfolio-Site from Bernd Manjou Janzen</h1> 

<p>Hi everyone, i am a web developer from berlin, i am a certified data processing merchant who added full stack web development to his toolbelt.
  with career foundry. 
This is my first project in my Career Foundry Full Stack Web Development Course. My portfolio web site. <br>
You can access it online:
<a href="https://manjou.github.io/portfolio-site/index.html" class="project-list__item__a">link to portfolio</a>

<p>I created the website with HTML, CSS and SASS, focusing on user experience and accessibility.

<p>Thanks to career foundry for providing me great study material and thanks also to my tutor Bless Darah and my Mentor Nizar Triki, who are supporting me</p>
<p>As a static web site is not very modern i will in the near future build a single page application to have a better user experience and put what i learned since then to use.</p>

<p>Want to reach out to me?</p>
