<h1>Portfolio-Site from Bernd Manjou Janzen</h1> 

<p>Hi everyone, i am a web developer from berlin, i am a certified data processing merchant who added full stack web development to his toolbelt.

This is my first project in my Career Foundry Full Stack Web Development Course. My portfolio web site. <br>
You can access it online:
<a href="https://manjou.github.io/portfolio-site/index.html" class="project-list__item__a">link to portfolio</a>

<p>This is a singlepage portfolio created with HTML, CSS and SASS, focusing on user experience and accessibility. I used some JavaScript for the hamburger menu and active nav links for scrolling.

<p>Thanks to career foundry for providing me great study material and thanks also to my tutor Bless Darah, Stanley Okwii and my Mentor Nizar Triki and Faizal Patel, who where supporting me on my learning path.</p>
