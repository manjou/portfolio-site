<p>Hi everyone, i am a web developer from berlin currently studying full stack web development with career foundry. 
this is my first project, my portfolio web site. <br>
As you can see, its work in progress. <br>
This is the first version on github.
<a href="https://manjou.github.io/portfolio-site/index.html" class="project-list__item__a">link to portfolio</a>

<p>I created the website with html, css and sass, focusing on user experience and accessibility.

<p>Thanks to career foundry for providing me great study material and thanks also to my tutor Bless Darah and my Mentor Nizar Triki, who are supporting me on my way to become a full stack web developer</p>
